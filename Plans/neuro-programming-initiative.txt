Neuro programing initiative
===========================


how to implement
==================

1. based on neural networks neural programming has to be defined.
2. define and redefine neural network based on observation
3. neuron is the storage node for some instructive, informative data;
4. well defined micro instruction is instructive data
5. well defined atomic data is informative data
6. atomic functions is the minimalist micro instruction
7. all neuron bears information signal, which mean information how to process information
8. neurons are interconnected.
9.
